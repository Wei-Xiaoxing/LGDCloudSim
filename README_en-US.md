# CPNSim

CPNSim: CPNSim is a simulation system for computing networks that is designed for large-scale, cross-regional, and
multi-data center scenarios.

There is also a visualization project for CPNSim that can be found
here: [CPNSim-visualization](https://github.com/slipegg/CPNSim-visualization).

CPNSim is designed for large-scale, cross-regional, and multi-data center scenarios for computing networks, and it supports affinity group task requests. In addition to supporting scheduling of user requests within data centers, it also supports partition state periodic synchronization, algorithm running time millisecond-level characterization, and provides the ability to schedule between data centers and parallel scheduling of multiple schedulers within data centers.</p>

On the one hand, CPNSim optimizes memory consumption during simulation runs, and on the other hand, it optimizes
simulation run efficiency, making the simulation system capable of fast simulation of tens of millions or even billions
of hosts and corresponding tens of thousands of requests per second.</p>

The simulation system architecture of CPNSim is as follows:

>* <p align="justify">If you want to use this framework to implement your own project, creating a fork is a bad solution. You should not modify the codebase to implement your project, but extend it by creating some subclasses. Unless you plan to redistribute your changes, you will end up with an incompatible and outdated framework version. The project is constantly evolving, and error correction is the top priority. Your fork and personal changes will miss these updates and high-performance improvements.</p>
